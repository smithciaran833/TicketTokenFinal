# 🔒 Security Audit Checklist - Solana NFT Ticketing System

## Overview
This checklist covers critical security considerations for auditing and deploying the Solana NFT Ticketing System. Each item should be verified before mainnet deployment.

## ✅ Smart Contract Security

### Access Control
- [ ] **Owner Checks**
  - ✓ All ticket operations verify `ticket.owner == signer`
  - ✓ Event updates restricted to `event.authority`
  - ✓ Freeze operations limited to authorized accounts
  - ✓ Burn operations require specific permissions

- [ ] **Role-Based Permissions**
  - ✓ `organizer` - Full event control
  - ✓ `gate_staff` - Validation only
  - ✓ `freeze_authorities` - Security operations
  - ✓ `burn_authorities` - Ticket destruction

- [ ] **PDA Authority**
  - ✓ Only program can modify PDA accounts
  - ✓ Seeds prevent collision attacks
  - ✓ Bumps stored for efficiency

### Input Validation
- [ ] **String Length Checks**
  ```rust
  // Verified in create_event.rs
  if name.len() > 100 {
      return Err(TicketError::EventNameTooLong.into());
  }
  ```

- [ ] **Numeric Bounds**
  - ✓ Batch mint limited to 100 tickets
  - ✓ Prices must be > 0
  - ✓ Event dates must be future
  - ✓ Transfer count tracked (no overflow)

- [ ] **Timestamp Validation**
  - ✓ Event start/end times logical
  - ✓ Delegate transfers have expiration
  - ✓ Validation within event window

### State Transitions
- [ ] **Ticket Lifecycle**
  ```
  Created → Transferred* → Validated → Used/Burned
                ↓
             Frozen → Unfrozen
  ```
  - ✓ Cannot transfer used tickets
  - ✓ Cannot validate frozen tickets
  - ✓ Cannot burn without validation
  - ✓ Cannot double-spend tickets

- [ ] **Event States**
  - ✓ Active → Cancelled (with restrictions)
  - ✓ Cannot modify after cancellation
  - ✓ Ticket sales stop when sold out

### Financial Security
- [ ] **Payment Verification**
  ```rust
  // In mint_ticket.rs
  let required_amount = match tier.as_str() {
      "general" => event.general_price,
      "vip" => event.vip_price,
      _ => return Err(TicketError::InvalidTicketTier.into()),
  };
  ```

- [ ] **No Reentrancy**
  - ✓ State updates before transfers
  - ✓ Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern
  - ✓ No external calls in critical sections

- [ ] **Overflow Protection**
  - ✓ Using checked math operations
  - ✓ Supply limits enforced
  - ✓ Transfer count uses u32 (sufficient)

## 🛡️ Fraud Prevention

### Double-Spend Protection
- [ ] **Entry Validation**
  - ✓ `entry_validated` flag prevents reentry
  - ✓ Validation records are permanent
  - ✓ Timestamp tracking for all scans

- [ ] **Transfer Tracking**
  ```rust
  pub struct Ticket {
      pub transfer_count: u32,
      pub transfer_history: Vec<(Pubkey, Pubkey, i64, String)>,
      // Full audit trail
  }
  ```

### Freeze Mechanism
- [ ] **Immediate Response**
  - ✓ Instant freeze capability
  - ✓ Blocks all operations
  - ✓ Detailed evidence storage
  - ✓ Only organizer can unfreeze

- [ ] **Freeze Reasons**
  ```rust
  pub enum FreezeReason {
      SuspectedFraud,
      DuplicateDetected,
      PaymentIssue,
      SecurityConcern,
      LegalHold,
      Other,
  }
  ```

### Delegate Transfer Security
- [ ] **Email Privacy**
  - ✓ SHA256 hashing of emails
  - ✓ No plaintext storage
  - ✓ Claim codes generated securely

- [ ] **Time Limits**
  ```rust
  require!(
      delegate_authority.expires_at > Clock::get()?.unix_timestamp,
      TicketError::DelegateExpired
  );
  ```

## 🔍 Common Attack Vectors

### 1. Ticket Duplication
**Risk**: Creating multiple tickets with same ID
**Mitigation**: 
- ✓ PDA derivation ensures uniqueness
- ✓ Sequential ticket IDs
- ✓ Event tracks total minted

### 2. Unauthorized Transfers
**Risk**: Stealing tickets from legitimate owners
**Mitigation**:
```rust
constraint = ticket.owner == from.key() @ TicketError::NotTicketOwner
```

### 3. Gate Bypass
**Risk**: Entering without valid ticket
**Mitigation**:
- ✓ Multiple validation types
- ✓ Gate staff authorization
- ✓ Permanent validation records

### 4. Price Manipulation
**Risk**: Buying tickets below price
**Mitigation**:
- ✓ Price validation in mint functions
- ✓ Tier verification
- ✓ No dynamic pricing in contract

### 5. Denial of Service
**Risk**: Blocking legitimate operations
**Mitigation**:
- ✓ No unbounded loops
- ✓ Limited batch operations
- ✓ Efficient PDA lookups

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

   await program.methods.freezeTicket(
     { suspectedFraud: {} },
     "Security incident - investigating"
   ).accounts({...}).rpc();
   ```

2. **Notify Stakeholders**
   - Event organizers
   - Affected ticket holders
   - Security team

3. **Investigate**
   - Review transaction logs
   - Analyze freeze evidence
   - Identify attack vector

4. **Remediate**
   - Patch vulnerability
   - Upgrade program if needed
   - Unfreeze legitimate tickets

### Program Upgrade Process
```bash
# 1. Build new version
cargo build-sbf

# 2. Test thoroughly
anchor test

# 3. Deploy upgrade
solana program deploy \
  --program-id <PROGRAM_ID> \
  --upgrade-authority <MULTISIG> \
  target/deploy/ticket_core.so
```

## 🔐 Best Practices

### For Developers

   - Validate all parameters
   - Check array bounds
   - Verify account ownership

2. **Fail Securely**
   - Use explicit error types
   - No silent failures
   - Log security events

3. **Minimize Attack Surface**
   - Keep functions focused
   - Limit admin capabilities
   - Use time-based restrictions

### For Auditors
1. **Check State Consistency**
   - Verify all state transitions
   - Ensure atomic operations
   - Check for race conditions

2. **Verify Math Operations**
   - No overflows/underflows
   - Correct decimal handling
   - Proper rounding

3. **Review Access Patterns**
   - Correct signer checks
   - Proper PDA validation
   - Authority verification

### For Operators
1. **Monitor Continuously**
   - Track freeze events
   - Watch for anomalies
   - Alert on suspicious patterns

2. **Maintain Backups**
   - Export event data
   - Track ticket states
   - Document incidents

3. **Plan for Scaling**
   - Set appropriate limits
   - Monitor performance
   - Prepare for growth

## 📊 Security Metrics

Track these metrics for security health:

1. **Freeze Rate**: Frozen tickets / Total tickets
2. **Transfer Velocity**: Transfers per ticket per day
3. **Validation Errors**: Failed validations / Total scans
4. **Delegate Claims**: Successful claims / Total delegates
5. **Double-Entry Attempts**: Blocked reentries / Total validations

## 🏁 Conclusion

Security is an ongoing process. This checklist should be:
- ✅ Reviewed before each deployment
- ✅ Updated with new threats
- ✅ Shared with security team
- ✅ Used for regular audits

Remember: The cost of prevention is always less than the cost of incident response.
